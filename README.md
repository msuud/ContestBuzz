# ContestBuzz - Your Personal Competitive Programming Notifier
With multiple contests happening across various platforms, staying updated and prepared can be a hassle for competitive programmers.

ContestBuzz is a smart contest tracking and notification platform that helps users stay informed about upcoming and ongoing coding contests across popular competitive programming websites — all in one place.

## Contest Aggregation & Notification System
We used the Clist.by API to fetch real-time contest data from 5 major competitive programming platforms:
CodeForces, CodeChef, LeetCode, AtCoder and GeeksforGeeks.

## How it works:
- The Home Page displays all upcoming contests.
On the Contests Page, users can:
- Filter contests by selected platforms
- View ongoing and upcoming contests
- Click the calendar icon to save contest date and time
- Click "Notify Me" to receive an email alert 1 hour before the contest starts

## Tech Stack
